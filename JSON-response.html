  <h1>Interpreting responses from the server in JSON</h1> 
     <div>
         <p>In the example code, the two lines <pre>var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
             console.log(response);</pre> are responsible for parsing the data returned from the server and logging the parsed JSON object data to the console.</p>
         
         <p>If you look at the console after executing console.log(response), you will see a formatted JSON string containing all the information about Faker's stream.</p>

         <p>If you look at the image above, all the information is in key value pairs. If I wanted to get the broadcaster's language in a variable I could write the following line of code. <pre>var fakerLanguage = response.broadcaster_language</pre> According to the JSON formatted response string, his language is "ko". If I wanted to see what game he is playing I could write, <pre>response.game</pre> and assign it to a variable.</p>
