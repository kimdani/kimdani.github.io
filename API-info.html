  <h1>What is an API?</h1>
     <div>
         <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of endpoints (URL/source of data) that any user with an API key or client ID can use to access and return information from a server's database. AN API is basically the middle man between a developer and a server, fetching responsedata from the server following a developer's request. The API should also tell the user what types of information can be requested as well as how to request the data.</p>
