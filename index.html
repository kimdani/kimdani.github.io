  <h1>Welcome to my Twitch API How to Guide!</h1>
     <div>
         <p>Twitch.tv is a platform that allows users to stream live videos for any audience. Twitch has come quite a long way, in the past most streams were of individual streamers playing video games, but now there are some video game tournaments that stream for hundreds of thousands of viewers. There are even IRL (in real life) streams which are  similar to vlogs, except the streamer can interact with their users in real time (think Facebook live videos).</p>
         
         <p>This how to guide will introduce you to the Twitch API and explore some functionalities that the API is capable of. The guide assumes that you have some fundamental HTML/CSS and Javascript knowledge.</p>
